# System Building Steps
Building a ticket management and support system requires sequential steps to ensure the system operates efficiently and effectively.
Here are the steps to build the system:

1. **[Add Users](./system-needs#إضافة-المستخدمين-وتحديد-صلاحياتهم)**
   - In this phase, you add the users who will interact with the system and define each user's permissions according to their role in the system.

2. **[Create Support Representatives Group](./system-needs#إضافة-مجموعة-المستخدمين)**
   - You create a group that includes support representatives who will be responsible for handling tickets and providing support.

3. **[Build System Module](./building-the-system/creating-module)**
   - In this phase, you design and build the customer support system module, which includes basic functions such as creating tickets, routing tickets, tracking tickets, and processing them.

4. **[Create Entity](./building-the-system/creating-entity)**
   - In this phase, you define the entities of the customers in the system, such as customers and support representatives, and specify the important data that must be stored.

8. **[Create Queries](./building-the-system/creating-queries)**
   - In this phase, you design database queries that allow users to search and view tickets effectively.

9. **[Create Views](./building-the-system/creating-views)**
   - In this phase, you design and implement view interfaces that allow users to create new support tickets and review the status of their tickets.

10. **[Create Summaries](./building-the-system/creating-summaries)**
    - We design and develop a summary module that enables users to quickly access key information.

11. **[Create Reports](./building-the-system/creating-reports)**
    - We create a system for generating and displaying the necessary reports to monitor and evaluate system performance.

12. **[Test the System](./testing-the-system)**
    - In this phase, you conduct tests to ensure that the system operates correctly and efficiently.
