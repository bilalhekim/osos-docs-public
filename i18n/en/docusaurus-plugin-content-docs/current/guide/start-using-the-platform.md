## Administration Interfaces {#administration-interfaces}
### Differences Between User and Administrator Interfaces {#how-it-differs}
The main difference between user and administrator interfaces lies in permissions and access to content and functions within the application. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

**Administrator Interfaces:**
1. **Full Permissions:** The administrator has full permission to view and control all services and pages within the application. They can access the administration section, including creating and editing content and settings.
2. **Access to Administration:** The administrator can access the administration section and make necessary modifications to the system, such as adding new users or modifying their permissions and configuring general application settings.
3. **View All Services and Pages:** The administrator can see all available services and different pages within the application, regardless of access permissions.

**User Interfaces:**
1. **Limited Permissions:** The user has limited permissions based on their role or level within the application. Their permissions may be restricted to accessing only the services and pages they have access rights to.
2. **Limited Access:** The user can access only the services and pages they are authorized to access. They will not see content or functions beyond their permissions.
3. **Limited Capabilities:** In many applications, regular users have limited capabilities compared to administrators. For example, they may be able to submit service requests and monitor their status but will not have the ability to modify system settings or access sensitive information.

This way, a different experience is provided for the administrator and user within the application, where the administrator can access all functions and content, while the user’s permissions are limited to the functions and content granted by the system administration.

### Main Sections of Administration Interfaces {#administration-interfaces-layout}

   - **Counters:** Allows the administrator to add and edit counters and display them as a table.

**2. Applications:**
