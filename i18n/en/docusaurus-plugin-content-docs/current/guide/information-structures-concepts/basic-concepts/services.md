# Services
In the platform, a service represents the functionalities created within the system and offered to users through external interfaces. These services are diverse to meet the varying needs of users and aim to provide the required functions and information easily and efficiently.

## Important to Know

### Difference Between a Service and a Normal Entity
Entities and services are interconnected, with a service being a type of entity. However, to implement a service correctly, certain conditions must be met. These include providing an effective workflow and carefully selecting the target audience.

### Service Audience
The audience using services on the platform is divided into two main groups: authenticated and anonymous users.

#### Authenticated Users
- These users have created accounts on the platform and have had their identity or personal data verified.
- They use the services as trusted users and typically have additional privileges or enhanced capabilities on the platform.
- This category might include people who registered using an email address or a specific phone number.

#### Anonymous Users
- These users can access services without needing to register or provide any personal information.
- This category might include visitors who browse the content or service without creating an account.
- They may have limited access to certain features or data compared to authenticated users.

### Service Category
Service category is one of the basic lists that include a set of values used to define the type of service in the system. Determining the type of service is essential as it helps organize and categorize services logically according to their characteristics and nature. When creating a new service, its type must be specified from the available values in this list. This procedure provides a unified and organized structure for services within the system, facilitating easy management, modification, and tracking of these services in the future.

### Inbox
The "Inbox" page contains all incoming service requests that the user is responsible for or that require their approval at a certain step. It allows the user to access this page to review the requests directed to them or that they need to inspect. The details related to each request are displayed clearly, enabling the user to take appropriate actions. This page helps organize and facilitate the follow-up of tasks and operations that require user intervention.

### My Requests
The "My Requests" page provides users with a comprehensive view of outgoing requests and includes all the services they have requested in the system. This page allows users to review and track the status of the requests they have submitted. The page displays request details in an organized manner, making it easier for users to follow the progress of each request and understand the stages it has gone through.
