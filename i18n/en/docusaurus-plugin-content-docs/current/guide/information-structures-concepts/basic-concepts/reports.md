3. **Accurate Data Presentation:** Data is provided in the form of tables and charts, contributing to the presentation of precise and clear evidence that aids in making correct decisions.

4. **Time and Effort Saving:** Instead of manually analyzing data, reports can save time and effort by providing calculated and organized data.
