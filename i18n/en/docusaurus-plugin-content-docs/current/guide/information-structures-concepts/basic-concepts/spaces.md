# Spaces

A **Space** is a core entity within the system used to manage and configure a set of data or operations independently or as a sub-part of another space. Spaces help users categorize and organize work clearly and separately based on their needs.

## Benefits of a Space

**Autonomy**
- Independent spaces can be defined to operate completely separately without being linked to other spaces.

**Flexible Management**
- Each space has one or more administrators who control its settings and user permissions.
- It is possible to manage the type of space, its status (active or inactive), along with other specific configurations.

**Easy Navigation**
- The system allows end-users to easily navigate between different spaces they have been added to.

**Custom Settings**
- Ability to customize details such as the icon, type, and domain identifier.
- An integrated system ensures security and data integrity, including link and identifier verification.

## Why Use Spaces?
They enable you to create a customized environment for each project or department, isolated from or shared with other spaces. This allows for separate customization of applications, data, and permissions for each space, making operations management easier, enhancing privacy, and providing greater flexibility in organizing work without overlap between different projects or departments.
