# Lists

Lists are a collection of values sharing the same property across multiple entities. Entries can be added to lists either by referencing existing data in entities or by entering custom data.

## Important to Know

### Key Features of a List
**Efficiency and Organization:** Lists help maintain data organization and facilitate quick access. When managing data in lists, specific values can be retrieved quickly based on their location, enhancing data access efficiency.

**Flexibility:** Lists can store a variety of value types, including strings, integers, decimals, boolean values, and even complex objects. This flexibility allows businesses to use lists for a wide range of applications, such as storing customer IDs, product details, transaction data, and more.

**Facilitate Collaboration and Sharing:** Lists can serve as a common format for sharing data between different systems or components, both within and outside an organization. This facilitates collaboration and integration between systems and teams.

### Types of Lists
A basic form of lists where items are data values of a single type. These include:
   - **Numeric Values:** Integers and decimals.
   - **Text Values:** Strings, such as "Days of the Week."
   - **Date Values:** Dates, such as (1/01/2023).
   - **Date and Time Values:** Dates with time, such as (1/01/2023 - 12:00).
   - **Time Values:** Times, such as (03:11:07 AM).

### Input Lists
These contain more advanced data structures. Each entry in these lists typically represents a complex object consisting of related data sets. They are used to manage and process related information.

### Tree Lists
These are used to represent hierarchical relationships between data. Organized in a hierarchical structure where each node has a parent and child nodes. They are used to represent complex structures resembling a tree.
Key characteristics of tree lists include:
   - **Hierarchy:** Organized hierarchically.
   - **Linking:** Nodes are connected by "branches."
   - **Branches:** Extend from the root node to the child nodes.
