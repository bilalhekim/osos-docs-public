## Links Entity
The **Links Entity** allows you to display and manage entries within the sidebar. This entity enables users to easily add and organize entries, which are arranged according to the specified **order field** value. Whether the entries relate to modules, galleries, pages, reports, or have no specific type, you can manage them effectively and customize access permissions based on your needs.
