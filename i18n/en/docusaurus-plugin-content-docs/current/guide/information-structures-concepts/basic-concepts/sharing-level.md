# Sharing Levels

The **Sharing Level** refers to the scope of sharing modules or applications across spaces and users within the system. It allows you to manage data privacy by controlling how widely modules and applications are accessible. The sharing level is defined when creating a new module or application. It is categorized into two types:

- **Public:** The module or application is available to all spaces and users.
- **Private:** The module or application is available only within the primary space and cannot be used or viewed in other spaces.

## Viewing Modules by Sharing Level
- **Modules with Public Sharing Level:** The module and all its entities are defined across all spaces and are available for use by all space users.
- **Modules with Private Sharing Level:** The module and all its entities are visible only within the primary space.

## Viewing Applications by Sharing Level
*Applications refer to "Pages, Galleries, Reports, Charts":*
- **Applications with Public Sharing Level:** These applications are available to all spaces and can be viewed and accessed from any space.
- **Applications with Private Sharing Level:** These applications are available only within the primary space and do not appear in other, non-primary spaces.
