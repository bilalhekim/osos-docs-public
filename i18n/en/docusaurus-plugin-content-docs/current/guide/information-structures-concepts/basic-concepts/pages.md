# Pages

Pages are a display tool provided by the system for administrators to introduce the system and facilitate users' access to provided features and services. These pages are designed to ensure a smooth and easy user experience. Pages serve several purposes, including:

1. **System Introduction:** Pages help in presenting detailed information about the system in an organized and clear manner. Administrators can provide a comprehensive description of the system, its features, and the benefits users can gain from using it.

2. **User Guidance:** Pages offer a design that makes it easy for users to browse content and find the features and services they are looking for. Pages can logically organize information and provide a list of links or buttons that simplify access to various sections and services.

3. **Enhancing User Experience:** By providing a smooth and well-organized page design, users can easily interact with the system and use the available features without difficulty. This ease of use contributes to improving user experience and satisfaction.

4. **Displaying Important Information:** Administrators can use pages to display important information or announcements about system updates, and provide guidelines or instructions to users on how to use certain features.

Overall, pages are an important tool for providing essential information and facilitating user access to services and features in an organized and appealing manner.

## Important to Know
### Page Levels
Page levels in the platform refer to the levels of information display in pages that users interact with. These levels aim to organize and direct the way data is presented based on the scope of the module and entities in the system.

#### Module-Level Page
This page allows users to browse all data within each entity that belongs to a specific module. In other words, users can view all records and various information related to entities within that module only. This enables users to get a comprehensive view of the data within this module.

#### General Page
This page allows users to view data across all entities within all modules in the system. Simply put, users can access a wide range of data from various modules and entities in the system. This enables users to view and compare data between different modules and entities.

### Default Pages
The concept of default pages is crucial in web system and application design. This principle involves determining the page that will be automatically displayed to the user when accessing the system without needing to specify a particular page in the URL. There are two main types of default pages:

#### Anonymous Access Default Page
In this case, a default page is set to be available to everyone without needing to log in. This means anyone accessing the system will be automatically directed to this page, whether they have logged in or not. This can be useful for displaying a homepage or providing general content to everyone.

#### Authenticated Default Page
In this case, a default page is specified to appear only after logging into the system. Once the user successfully logs in, they will be automatically directed to this page. This can be useful for directing registered users to their dedicated homepage or providing a customized interface post-login.

In summary, the concept of default pages helps direct users to the appropriate pages automatically without needing to specify the page each time they visit the system.
