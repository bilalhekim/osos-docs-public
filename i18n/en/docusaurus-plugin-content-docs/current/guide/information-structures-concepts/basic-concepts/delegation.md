# Delegations
# What is Delegation?

The **Delegation System** allows a user to delegate another user to perform actions on their behalf, granting the delegate the ability to use the system with the same permissions as the delegator for a specified period of time.  
By using the delegation feature, collaboration between users is enhanced while maintaining system flexibility and data security.


## What Can the Delegate Do?

**View Data:**
- The delegate can view the data belonging to the delegator.
- Ability to filter entries using custom query conditions.

**Perform Actions:**
- **Create New Entries:** Input new data into the delegator's entities.
- **Edit Existing Entries:** Update current data entries.
- **Add Comments:** Record additional notes on entries.

**Execute Workflows:**
- Take actions within active workflows, such as submitting requests, approving steps, or completing processes.

## How is This Recorded in the System?

- The action (create, edit, or comment) is completed **in the name of the delegate**.
- The system logs that the delegate performed the action **on behalf of the delegator**.
