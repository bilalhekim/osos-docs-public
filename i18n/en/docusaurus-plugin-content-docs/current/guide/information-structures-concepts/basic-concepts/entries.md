# Entries
Entries in the platform represent the data or values that users input and interact with, and upon which other operations in the system are performed. These entries can be diverse and include various types of information depending on the nature and purpose of the system and the structure of the entities. Entries are a fundamental part of the system's interaction with users and external data sources.

## Types of Entries
### Active Entries
Active entries are those that users can add to the entity in the system. Individuals who have the appropriate permissions can add these entries. These entries are part of the data records or entities in the system, and users with the right permissions can view and update these entries.

### Obsolete Entries
Obsolete entries refer to data or information that no longer fits or complies with the new structure or current workflow of the entity or system. These entries are often outdated or incompatible with the changes made in the system, which can negatively impact the accuracy and efficiency of operations. Obsolete entries typically result from changes in data structure or workflow, such as database updates or workflow changes. These entries must be handled carefully to update, adjust, and align them with the new structure and requirements of the entity or system.

### Archived Entries
Archived entries are those that have been moved to the archive or permanently stored by users who have the permission to archive in the system. Archiving is done to maintain organized records of data and information and to keep important data away from active data that is frequently interacted with. Archived entries are often non-editable or non-deletable and are preserved for future reference or review purposes.

## Important to Know
### Metadata
Metadata represents the data that provides a description of the entry for filtering or querying purposes. It includes information such as who created or modified the entry and the dates of creation and updates.

### Discussion
Displays comments added to the entry. This section allows users to add their comments to the specified entry and browse previous comments added by other users. The comments added in this section remain visible to other users who review the discussion based on their permissions.

### History
A log that displays the dates and times of all changes made to the entry. The history log includes details of updates and additions that occurred, as well as interactions that resulted from these updates and additions. Users can see who performed these actions, when they occurred, and the associated details.
