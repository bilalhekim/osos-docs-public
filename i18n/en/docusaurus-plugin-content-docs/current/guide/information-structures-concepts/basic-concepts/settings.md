# Settings

**Settings** serve as the central gateway that enables system administrators to align the platform with their operational and business needs at various levels. Through the settings panel, administrators can control the user experience—from general appearance to finer details such as language, time zone, and date/time formats.


**Settings operate across three hierarchical levels:**

- **Space Level:** Allows customization of the appearance and functions of a specific workspace without affecting other spaces.

- **Organization Level:** Enables the application of unified policies across all spaces within a particular organization, ensuring consistency in visual identity and functionality.

- **User Level:** Grants each user the freedom to personalize their experience according to their preferences, within the limits set by administrators.

Through these settings, the organization can define default themes, specify supported languages, configure time zones, and set date and time formats—ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across web and mobile applications.  
This approach makes the system more flexible and scalable while maintaining a unified visual identity and performance aligned with the expectations of all stakeholders.
