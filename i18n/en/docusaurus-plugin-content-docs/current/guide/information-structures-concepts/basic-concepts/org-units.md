# Organizational Structure
The organizational structure is a fundamental element in the platform that assists in managing institutions and organizations. It illustrates the organization and arrangement of its components and the relationships between them. The organizational structure serves as a crucial guide to understanding how an organization is organized and how its departments and units interact. Several aspects highlight the importance of the organizational structure's function:

1. Internal Organization: The organizational structure clarifies how organizational units within the institution are organized and how these units interact with each other. This organization reflects the management structure and the organizational hierarchy.

2. Defining Authority and Responsibilities: Through the organizational structure, it is possible to determine who is responsible for specific tasks and who has the authority to make decisions. This reduces role ambiguity and contributes to effective guidance and organization.

3. Facilitating Decision-Making: Thanks to the organizational structure, employees and administrators can understand the flow of information and decision-making processes. The organizational structure displays the flow of data and information between units and individuals.

4. Enhancing Coordination and Collaboration: The organizational structure helps improve coordination between different departments and organizational units. Employees can know who works with whom and how to collaborate to achieve the institution's goals.

5. Clarifying Relationships: The organizational structure shows the relationships between various organizational units and employees. This helps clarify the organizational chain and administrative direction.

Overall, the organizational structure contributes to a better understanding of the institution's organization, facilitates management and decision-making, and enhances coordination and collaboration between departments and individuals.
