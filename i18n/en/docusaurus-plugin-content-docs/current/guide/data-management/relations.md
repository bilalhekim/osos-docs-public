# Relations {#relations}

Relations are the links that connect different entities in the system. They are divided into two types: inbound relations and outbound relations.

## Inbound Relation {#inbound-relation}

An inbound relation is where the current entity is the "parent entity." To access inbound relations, use the "Inbound Relations" option in the relations tab of the entity.

### Viewing Inbound Relations {#viewing-inbound-relation}

- The relations associated with the entity as the parent appear as cards containing (relation name, relation icon, related entity, relation field).
- To create a new relation, follow the steps mentioned [here](../my-first-application/my-first-app-modifying-the-tasks-system.md#adding-a-relation).
- To modify relation data, click on it to display a form with the relation details, then enter the new values and click the "Finish" button.

### Removing Inbound Relation {#removing-inbound-relation}

1. Click the delete icon next to the relation information.
2. A confirmation message will appear.
3. After confirming, the relation will be permanently deleted and cannot be undone.

An outbound relation is where the current entity is the "child entity." To access outbound relations, use the "Outbound Relations" option in the relations tab of the entity.
