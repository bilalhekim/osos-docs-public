## Listing Lists {#listing-lists}

A list is a data structure that groups a set of items with similar characteristics in an organized way, making them easily accessible and usable by other system features. Creating lists is essential for organizing and storing data and separating similar items into logical groups.

### Types of Lists:

1. **Entity-based List**: The records in this list are entries within the entity.
2. **Text Values List**: The records are text values and can be hierarchical.
3. **Numbers List**: The records are numbers and can be hierarchical.
4. **Date List**: The records are dates selected from the calendar and can be hierarchical.
5. **Time List**: The records are times that can be adjusted based on the time zone and can be hierarchical.
6. **Datetime Values List**: The records are datetime values and can be hierarchical.

## Viewing a List {#list-detail}

After creating the list, it can be accessed via the search button on the Lists page. The created lists will appear as clear and organized cards.

Each card includes:
1. The list name.
2. The icon.
3. The number of entries.
4. The selected data type.
5. The list management button for data actions.
