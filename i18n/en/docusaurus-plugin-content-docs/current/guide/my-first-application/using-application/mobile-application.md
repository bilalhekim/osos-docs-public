# Mobile Application Usage

You can use the mobile application to perform tasks such as viewing pages and tasks and their details.

## Downloading the App {#downloading-the-app}
Users can download the app from their respective app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) depending on their device's operating system. Once the app is installed on the device:
1. The user opens the app.
2. The user selects the app language (English - Arabic).
3. After selecting the language, the user can proceed either by adding their organization's URL or by continuing as a guest.

If the user chooses to proceed with their organization, they will be directed to the [login page](#logging-in-from-the-application). If the user chooses to continue as a guest, they can browse pages with anonymous permissions, such as the visitor page. The user can select "Login" from the bottom sidebar, which will return them to the language selection page and organization choice, then [login](#logging-in-from-the-application).

## Logging In from the Mobile App {#logging-in-from-the-application}
After downloading the app and selecting their organization, users will be directed to the login page, where they need to fill in the following information:
1. **Username/Email (Mandatory):** The user must enter their username or email address.
2. **Password (Mandatory):** The user must enter their password.
3. **Remember Me (Optional):** When enabled, the user's login information is saved, and the fields will be auto-filled next time.
If the user forgets their password, they can click on "Forgot Password?" to be directed to the password recovery page. They need to enter their email and click "Recover Password," and a link with password reset instructions will be sent to their email.

## Using the Task Management Application on Mobile {#using-the-tasks-system-from-the-mobile-app}
After successfully logging into the system, the main page of the Task Management Application (user page) will appear. Users can navigate to the task view page using the "Go To" icon at the bottom of the screen, which shows a list of pinned pages they have access to.

### Viewing Tasks
In the "Go To" page, after selecting the "Task Management" page, the option to view the view appears. When the user clicks on the view, it displays the tasks in a calendar or task board view.

2. Select the desired display mode from the display options.
3. Close the settings window.

1. Clicking the settings button next to the search bar.
2. Clicking the filters field.
3. Choosing filter conditions (entry fields, entry descriptions, group conditions).
4. Filling in the conditions.
5. Saving the specified query.
6. Closing the filter window.
7. Closing the settings window to see the filtered results.

### Sorting Tasks
Users can sort tasks in ascending or descending order based on their preferences by:
1. Clicking the settings button next to the search bar.
2. Choosing "Sort By."
3. Selecting the sort direction (ascending or descending).

These steps allow users to efficiently manage and interact with their tasks using the mobile application.
