# Building Views

You can build views in the platform by following these steps:

## Building My Tasks View

1. **Select the Task Entity:**
   - Start by selecting the task entity that was previously created.

2. **Access the Entity:**
   - Log in to the chosen entity.

3. **Navigate to the Interfaces Tab:**
   - Go to the "Interfaces" tab within the entity.

4. **Add a New View:**
   - Click on the "Add New View" option.

5. **Enter View Information:**
   - A form will appear requesting the following information:
     - **Name:** A mandatory, translatable text field (e.g., "My Tasks").
     - **Description:** A translatable long text field (optional) for describing the view.
     - **Entity:** A dropdown list to select the entity associated with the view.
     - **Icon:** A mandatory dropdown list for selecting an icon.
     - **View Source:** A mandatory dropdown list to choose between entries and queries.

6. **Set View Source:**
   - Choose "Queries" as the source for the view.

7. **Select the Query for the View:**
   - Select the pre-created query, for example, "My New Tasks."

8. **Choose Fields:**
   - Use the dropdown list to select the fields you want to display, such as Title, Description, Status, Due Date, and Assignee.

9. **Access Permissions:**
    - **Set Permission:** Assign the appropriate permission for the view. Here, we will use "Anonymous."
    - **Get the Link:** A link will be automatically generated, which can be shared with end users to access the tasks.
    - **Copy the Link:** After creating the view, copy the generated link.

10. **Display Entry List:**
    - **Table View:** Choose the fields to display in a table, such as Title, Description, Status, Due Date, and Assignee.
    - **Kanban Board View:** Configure the board to display information such as main and subheadings and due dates. Set up the Kanban board to include columns like "To Do," "In Progress," "Done," and "Uncategorized."

11. **Display Task Details:**
    - Enable the task details view and specify all the relevant fields.

12. **Save Settings:**
    - Click on the "Finish" button to save the view settings.

13. **Publish the View:**
    - After saving, you will be directed to the views page. Click on the "Publish" button to make the page available to those with the link.

## Building Tasks View

Follow the same steps as above but modify the access permissions to assign the responsible person who can view the page. Enable the options to add/edit tasks and select all fields for all available options to allow the responsible person to add and edit tasks within the view.

## View Access Permissions

When navigating to the interfaces, you will find three options for permissions:
  - **Authenticated:** Allows the view to be accessible to all authenticated users.
  - **Anonymous:** The option we chose. You can copy the link and share it with anyone.
  - **Restricted:** You can specify the users and groups who can access the view by enabling the appropriate option.

## Summaries

   - First, select your task entity.

2. **Log in to the Task Entity:**
