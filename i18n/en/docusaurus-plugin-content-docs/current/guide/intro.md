## Core Concepts of the Platform {#intro-core-concepts}
The core concepts of the platform include a set of elements and terms that form the foundation of the system's structure and functions. Here is an explanation of each of these concepts:
1. **Administration Section:** This part controls the organization and management of data and information within the system. Only administrators can access this section, and they set the conditions and restrictions on who can access and modify the data.
2. **User Applications:** These include the applications that regular users can access to view and modify data according to the conditions set by the administrators. These applications are designed to facilitate the use of information and enable exploration and analysis.
3. **Entities and Entries:** These form the basic structure for organizing data. Each entity represents a table of information, and entries represent the records or rows within these tables. These structures are fundamental for storing and organizing data.
4. **Queries and Statistics:** Allow retrieving, analyzing, and filtering data according to specific criteria. Queries can be saved for later use.
5. **Views:** Display and modify data according to set permissions. There can be different views for the same data to meet the needs of different user groups.
6. **Pages:** Display unstructured and static information attractively. Pages can be designed to display specific information in an easy-to-use format for users.
7. **Modules:** Represent an integrated set of elements related to a logical or conceptual scope. They help in organizing and grouping structures and functions within a single scope.

These core concepts of the platform form the structure and reactions of the system and contribute to facilitating the organization and management of data and information, achieving efficiency and maximizing their use.
